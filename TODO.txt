 - py2exe: test operation of "optimize" and "unbuffered" flags
 * in-place upgrade of resources in executable files
    * with a separate wrapper program that can be spawned to modify
      the in-use executable 
 * respect various distutils settings e.g. verbose, dry_run
 * tests for customisable bootstrap process
 * hooks for code signing etc in the build process
 * think about hooks for upgrade events

   * Frameworks/.../Version/Python changes even when using the same
     build environment.  Why?  What can we do about it?
