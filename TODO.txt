 * sudo_osx: let the auth dialog get keyboard focus.
 * get realpath of sys.executable (may have to do this by hand, hard in RPython)
 * when compiling the bootstrap exes, copy resources (e.g. icons) from
   the frozsen exes
 * cache executables compiled by compile_to_bootstrap_exe, so we don't
   have to repeat the process in the common case where they're all the same.
 * py2exe: test operation of "optimize" and "unbuffered" flags
 * py2exe: support DLLs as well as executables (maybe?)
 * respect various distutils settings e.g. verbose, dry_run
 * think about hooks for upgrade events

 py2app:
   * Frameworks/.../Version/Python changes even when using the same
     build environment.  Why?  What can we do about it?
