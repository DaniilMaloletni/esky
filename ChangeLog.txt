v0.4.0:

    * some backwards-incompatible API changes:
        * replace Esky.install_update(v) with Esky.auto_update()
        * new utility methods Esky.install_version(v)/Esky.uninstall_version(v)
        * rename Esky.fetch_update(v) to Esky.fetch_version(v)
    * added a few well-known hacks to get py2exe to play nice with common
      third-party packages.
    * implemented a custom chainload() function for py2exe.
    * added more version-handling utility functions: get_all_versions,
      is_version_dir, is_installed_version_dir

v0.3.0:

    * added ability to bundle MSVCRT as a private assembly (this is off
      by default, since you must have a valid license to redistribute it).
    * refactored to support multiple freezing backends.
        * added support for freezing with py2exe.
