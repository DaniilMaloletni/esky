 * A custom loader for win32, since execv isn't great on that platform
      - would use LoadLibrary to bootstrap into the correct python dll
 * Bundle package_data and data_files into the distribution somehow
 * Build a constant bootstrapping library.zip, so it doesn't need overwriting.
   Currently I think the zipfile gets timestamps or something, leading us to
   replace it unnecessarily.
